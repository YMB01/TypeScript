Introduction To TypeScript

TypeScript is a statically-typed programming language that is a superset of JavaScript. It was developed and is maintained by Microsoft. TypeScript was created to address the challenges of building large-scale JavaScript applications and adds optional type annotations, classes, interfaces, and other features to the language.

The main benefits of using TypeScript include:

Type Safety :TypeScript introduces static typing to JavaScript, allowing developers to define variable types explicitly.

Improved Tooling:TypeScript enhances development tools and environments by providing type information.

Improved Maintainability:TypeScriptâ€™s strong typing and structured approach make codebases easier to manage over time.

Backwards Compatibility:TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.
